## About

This repo represents my main body of work in my first embedded systems course at UW. We were tasked with four different labs, all based around a simulated stop light, and we implemented a FSM and multiple technologies to create many different variations on the same project. Each lab is documented through PDF descriptions under `PDF Descriptions`. All of the files were written in C, with upwards of 85% of the code being written by myself (some base code was provided to us on the earlier projects, and a driver for the touch screen was also provided for us).
